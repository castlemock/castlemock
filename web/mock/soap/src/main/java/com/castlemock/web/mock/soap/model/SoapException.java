 * from this class because the {@link SoapControllerAdvice} will
 * only handle exceptions that is either an instance of the SoapException class or an instance from a class that
 * is inherit from the SoapException class. The {@link SoapControllerAdvice}
 * will transform the exception message into a SOAP response message. If an exception is thrown from the
 * {@link SoapServiceController}, the {@link ViewControllerAdvice}
 * will process the exception instead and a view will be sent as a response instead.
