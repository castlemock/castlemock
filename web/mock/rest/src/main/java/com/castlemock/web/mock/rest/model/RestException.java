/**
 * The RestException is the main exception for the all REST related issues. All REST related exceptions
 * should inherit from the class. It is important that all REST exceptions are inheriting
 * from this class because the {@link RestControllerAdvice} will
 * only handle exceptions that is either an instance of the RestException class or an instance from a class that
 * is inherit from the RestException class. The {@link RestControllerAdvice}
 * will transform the exception message into a REST response message. If an exception is thrown from the
 * {@link RestServiceController}, the {@link ViewControllerAdvice}
 * will process the exception instead and a view will be sent as a response instead.
