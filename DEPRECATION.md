# Castle Mock is No Longer Maintained
We would like to inform our users and contributors that the Castle Mock project is no longer being actively maintained. This means that the project will not receive any further updates, including bug fixes, new features, or security patches.

Castle Mock has served its purpose as an open-source tool for simulating and mocking SOAP and RESTful web services, and we are incredibly grateful to everyone who supported, contributed to, and used the project over the years.

While the codebase remains available in its current state, we recommend users evaluate alternative solutions for long-term or production use. The project will remain accessible for archival and educational purposes.

The [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/castlemock/castlemock) will also be deprecated and eventually deleted.

Thank you for being part of the Castle Mock journey.
