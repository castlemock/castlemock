**Castle Mock** is a web application that provides the functionality to mock out RESTful APIs and SOAP web services. This functionality allows client-side developers to completely mimic a server side behaviour and shape the responses themselves.

## About

**Castle Mock** can create mocked services based on WSDL, WADL, Swagger and RAML definition files. The web-services defined within the files will be mocked automatically by **Castle Mock**. Once the mocks for the web-services are created, they can be configured to mock the service or forward the request to the original endpoint. The response from the forwarded requests can be recorded automatically and used to create new mocked responses.

**Castle Mock** is completely free and open source (Apache License). It is built with Java and the application itself is deployed to an Apache Tomcat server.

## What to Use Castle Mock for and When to Use It

Use **Castle Mock** to mock out RESTful APIs and SOAP web services for testing purposes for when either performing system or integration tests. It is recommended to only use **Castle Mock** on an internal network and never be used publically. **Castle Mock** is **NOT** developed or meant for anything else other than for testing purposes.

## Download

Non-source downloads such as WAR files can be found on our website: [https://www.castlemock.com/](https://www.castlemock.com/). The WAR files can also be located and downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/castlemock/castlemock/releases).

## Installation

**Castle Mock** can be downloaded as Java Web Archive (.war) file and be deployed on a Apache Tomcat server (Java 21+ and Apache Tomcat 11). **Castle Mock** can also be deployed by using Docker. For more information go to the offical **Castle Mock** Docker page: [https://hub.docker.com/r/castlemock/castlemock/](https://hub.docker.com/r/castlemock/castlemock/).

Upon successful installation and deployment, **Castle Mock** can be accessed from the web browser:

    http://localhost:8080/castlemock
    
This will prompt you the login screen. When logging for the first time use the following credentials: 

    Username: admin 
    Password: admin 

It is recommended that the administrator profile gets updated with a more secure password. This is accomplish by going to the user page and choosing to update the profile.

Upon successful login, you will be able to create both SOAP and REST projects. SOAP and REST resources can either be created manually or created by importing resource descriptions, such as WSDL and WADL. All created resources can be mocked multiple times. Each resource can also be configured to have different response strategies, such as random and sequence
